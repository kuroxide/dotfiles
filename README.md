Pretty self-explanatory \
Note: `qalculate` folder goes in `.local/share`, not `.config` (unless you set up qalculate differently). \
Scripts:
- `hyprwrapper`: wrapper script to set envvars for Hyprland
- `fzfmenu`: a dmenu replacement script that uses fzy (edited from [this](https://gist.github.com/MahouShoujoMivutilde/b1fa83bc234b68dd164cb6e843965d75) script). Despite the name, it does not depend on fzf.
- `on-battery-switch`: a script that changes monitor refresh rate when unplugged from power (may need editing depending on your hardware)
