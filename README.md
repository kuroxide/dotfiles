Pretty self-explanatory \
Note: `qalculate` folder goes in `.local/share`, not `.config` (unless you set up qalculate differently). \
Wallpapers can be placed in `/hypr`. wallpaper.png is the desktop and wallpaper2.png is the lock screen. \
Scripts (put them in .local/bin or wherever you put your scripts):
- `hyprwrapper`: wrapper to set envvars for Hyprland
- `fzfmenu`: dmenu replacement that uses a terminal window and fzy (edited from [this](https://gist.github.com/MahouShoujoMivutilde/b1fa83bc234b68dd164cb6e843965d75) script). Despite the name, it does not depend on fzf.
- `on-battery-switch`: changes monitor refresh rate when unplugged from power (may need editing depending on your hardware)
- `usb-drive-detect`: detects and notifies when USB drives are plugged/unplugged (disabled by default)
